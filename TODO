    * p_test.go should be done over the wire, so to speak; that
        is, between two 127.0.0.1 endpoints
    * the protocol must be documented

2013-07-29
    * Node.AddEndPoint() must screen for identical endPoints
    * Adding a peer must add at least one connector
    * Need a simple protocol to allow nodes to talk to each other   # DONE
    * Change Peer, replacing list of connectors in NewPeer 
        parameters with list of endpoints (from which we determine 
        connectors)
    * Node.Close must close all open connections 
        - take care, servers may have MANY such connections
            * could put each Close() in separate goroutine

2013-07-27
    * Node.Close must close all open acceptors                      # DONE
    * node_test.go should add multiple 127.0.0.1:0 Tcp endpoints    # DONE
        - node initialization must create an Acceptor for each      # DONE
        - TestLocalHost must verify that each has a unique non-zero
            port (use GetEndPoint())
        - node.New() should create the 127.0.0.0/8 overlay          # DONE
            automatically, calling it "localhost" and setting
            its protocol as "ip"
    * Get rid of slice of open connections passed to Node being
        created !

2013-07-26
    * add logic that associates each node endpoint with an overlay,
        creating it where necessary
    * and test it

2013-07-22
    * rework to not use Overlay as concrete class; should           # DONE
        be using OverlayI and IPOverlay

2013-07-16
    * Node and Peer should extend a base class
        - Peer extends BaseNode                                     # DONE
        - Node extends BaseNode                                     # DONE
    * need peer_test.go
    * integrate gateways into Node
