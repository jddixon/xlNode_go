    * implement node.Save() and node.Load()
    * if a node is started with only the name, id, and lfs 
        specified, it should load its configuration from say 
        LFS/.xlattice/config
    * LFS will conventionally be ./tmp/nodeID/ in testing, where 
        the nodeID is in hex
   
    * extract localHost cluster configuration from localHost_test

    * extend localHostTest so that after configurations have
        been saved, all of the nodes in the cluster are shut 
        down and then all are restarted from their saved 
        configurations.  The save-and-reload should precede
        the communications checks.

    * problem with deserializing node: the listener is live         # FIXED

    * lfs is a path; it must be filtered accordingly
    * need peer.Parse() which converts a slice of strings back      # DONE
        into a Peer object
        - first version of parser can be quite strict
        - eventually should be syntactically liberal when
            parsing (although strict when writing)

    * p_test.go should be done over the wire, so to speak; that
        is, between two 127.0.0.1 endpoints
    * the protocol must be documented
    * add local file system = path to my private area on disk       # DONE
        for node 
        - need test of this capability
    * integrating gateways into node requires ability to create
        composite connections
        - Gateway extends Node
    * from 07-16: need peer_test.go                                 # DONE
    * need UDP transport

2013-07-29
    * Adding a peer must add at least one connector
    * Need a simple protocol to allow nodes to talk to each other   # DONE
    * Change Peer, replacing list of connectors in NewPeer 
        parameters with list of endpoints (from which we determine 
        connectors)
    * Node.Close must close all open connections 
        - take care, servers may have MANY such connections
            * could put each Close() in separate goroutine
