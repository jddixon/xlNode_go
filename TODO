    * add logic that associates each node endpoint with an overlay,
        creating it where necessary
    * and test it
        - TestLocalHost must create "localhost" overlay with addr
            range 127.0.0.0/8 and open acceptors on each endpoint
            in that range; multiple 127.0.0.1:0 endpoints creates
            that many unique acceptors; we can get the port using
            GetEndPoint(n)

    * rework to not use Overlay as concrete class; should
        be using OverlayI and IPOverlay

    * Node and Peer should extend a base class
        - Peer extends BaseNode                                     # DONE
        - Node extends BaseNode                                     # DONE
    * need peer_test.go
    * integrate gateways into Node
