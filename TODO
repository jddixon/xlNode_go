    * p_test.go should be done over the wire, so to speak; that
        is, between two 127.0.0.1 endpoints
    * the protocol must be documented
    * add local file system = path to my private area on disk       # DONE
        for node 
        - need test of this capability
        - node should be serializable, and if a node is started
            with only the id and lfs specified, it should load its 
            configuration from say lfs/.xlattice
    * integrating gateways into node requires ability to create
        composite connections
        - Gateway extends Node
    * from 07-16: need peer_test.go
    * need UDP transport

    * Adding a peer must add at least one connector
    * Need a simple protocol to allow nodes to talk to each other   # DONE
    * Change Peer, replacing list of connectors in NewPeer 
        parameters with list of endpoints (from which we determine 
        connectors)
    * Node.Close must close all open connections 
        - take care, servers may have MANY such connections
            * could put each Close() in separate goroutine
